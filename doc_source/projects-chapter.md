# Managing projects in Amazon Monitron<a name="projects-chapter"></a>

Projects are the foundation for using Amazon Monitron\. A project is where your team sets up the gateways, assets, and sensors that Amazon Monitron uses to detect the abnormal conditions that can lead to equipment failure\.

A project is structured like this: 

Project **→** site or sites **→** assets **→** positions **→** sensors 

You can't share these resources between projects\. Before you begin creating a project, we recommend that you carefully consider your project's needs\. Make sure that it contains all of the resources required to predict the maintenance needs for all of your assets\. 

Only the IT manager can create, update, and delete projects and use the Amazon Monitron console for those tasks\.
