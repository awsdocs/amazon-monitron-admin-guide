# Logging and Monitoring in Amazon Monitron<a name="monitron-logging"></a>

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of your Amazon Monitron applications\. To monitor Amazon Monitron console and mobile app actions, you can use AWS CloudTrail\. 

CloudTrail logs provide a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Amazon Monitron\. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to Amazon Monitron, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details\. For more information, see [Logging Amazon Monitron actions with AWS CloudTrail](logging-using-cloudtrail.md)\.
